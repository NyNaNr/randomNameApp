## Random Name App:displaying names randomly from the input list you provide

## DEMO
![RandomNameApp](https://github.com/NyNaNr/randomNameApp/assets/123739414/89a98732-ec8b-4aa4-8580-d9903c5bb839)

## Features
This is a web app that randomly displays names in a large format, similar to bingo. It can be used in various scenarios such as class or lecture roll calls, parties, and more. It is designed to be used while projected on a large monitor in classrooms or similar settings, and it is also compatible with smartphones and tablets. The app allows for displaying names in a large size, making it easy to view even from a distance. It is guaranteed to create excitement while waiting for the names to be revealed!


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
